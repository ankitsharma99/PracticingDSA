# BINARY HEAP:

## There are two types of Binary Heap, known as:
>   1. MIN HEAP.
>   2. MAX HEAP.

## A Binary Heap data structure follows these two properties:
>   1. It is a complete _Binary Tree_.
>   2. Every root node is smaller than the child node in case of MIN HEAP and the opposite in case of MAX HEAP.

__A Binary Heap is used to implement PRIORITY QUEUES__
### A binary heap is implemented using an array. However, it can also be implemented using other data structures such as linked list.
>   Formula for finding the left child: _(2 * index + 1)_.
>   Formula for finding the right child: _(2 * index + 2)_.
>   Formula for finding the parent node: _((i-1)/2)_.
